# fs-cms
Content management system for websites based on filesystem structure

# Development roadmap

-   Detect artifacts and templates

-   Embed simple artifacts into templates. Start with text. If you can embed text, 
    then everything else can be done via links, unless you are hosting the content.

-   Arrangement of artifacts with respect to each other.

-   Recursive artifacts. Evaluate a folder and produce an artifact.

-   Embed complex artifacts that are self-hosted: images, videos.

-   Embed artifacts that are hosted on other sites: link to soundcloud becomes
    embedded soundcloud player, link to googlemaps becomes google-map embedded on page.
    Maybe this is a pointless idea actually.
